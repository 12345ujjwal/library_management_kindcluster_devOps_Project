## Overall Learning 

During my internship in Cloud Computing and DevOps, I gained hands-on experience with AWS services such as EC2, S3, and Load Balancing. I worked with DevOps tools including Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana to build, deploy, and monitor applications. This experience strengthened my understanding of cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized environments.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
The LST and SST sessions at the Sure Trust Foundation played a significant role in shaping my professional and personal development. These sessions enhanced my understanding of professional ethics, effective communication, and workplace awareness. Through work culture and advocacy discussions, I developed a strong appreciation for integrity, gender equality, and respectful conduct in professional environments. Additionally, yoga and mindfulness practices helped me build self-discipline and manage stress effectively, while community engagement with elderly citizens strengthened my empathy and sense of social responsibility. Overall, these sessions contributed to my career readiness, personal growth, and a balanced lifestyle.

## **Community Services**
During my internship period, I participated in multiple community-oriented and professional development activities organized through the LST and SST sessions at the Skill India Institute. These initiatives were designed to build a bridge between technical expertise and social responsibility. By engaging in both social service and professional ethics workshops, I developed a well-rounded perspective on my role as both an engineer and a responsible citizen.
